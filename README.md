# Real_Estate_db_with_app
this project is working with postgresql and a gui to interact with db only , if you want to run it , first you have to download the postgresql then make a db in pgadmin simply by right clicking on detatbases then create option , next run the db_project.py to make the tables to db (remember to change the files headers with your actuall parameters to be able to connect to your db ) . now you have the tables in db (you can see them in pgadmin) after that you have to copy the inserts codes into a query file in your pgadmin by right clicking on tables then choose the query tool and run it . now you have a full db with tables so you can run the main.py to be able to use a very simple gui app which direcctly interacts with your db .
NOTE : if you want to change the db_project.py as your wish pls run the table_deleting.py first and then run your db_project.py
NOTE : this is a basic app interactor to db and not a full app for a client , you can change it and learn from it .


if you have anyother questions about db and the code pls let me know at : 21amirali2112@gmail.com i'll be in touch
